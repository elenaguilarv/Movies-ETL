# Movies-ETL
## Challenge
Instructions: Write a Python script that performs all three ETL steps on the Wikipedia and Kaggle data. Utilize the code already created but leave out any code that performs exploratory data analysis. Add code to handle potentially unforeseen errors due to changes in the underlying data.

### Goals
- Create an automated ETL pipeline
- Extract data from multiple sources
- Transform the data using pandas and regular expressions
- Load new data in PostgreSQL

## Assumptions/Conclusions
Document any assumptions that are being made (5+) in a cohesive written assignment. 
Use try-except blocks to account for unforeseen problems that may arise with new data.
